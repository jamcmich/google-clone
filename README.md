### Problem Solving

##### Styling Conventions

This project was my first exposure to using **[WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/guide/)** (an on-demand alternative to **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)**). Although Windi is convenient for styling elements on the fly, it suffers from the same issues as Tailwind: lack of legibility, inability to chain selectors, cluttering the DOM, etc. I realized the need for a consistent naming scheme after styling my first few React components and began researching a flexible solution.

After looking into the issue, I discovered a CSS naming convention created by BEM for writing cleaner and more readable class names. You can read up on the methodology with examples in **[BEM's official guide](http://getbem.com/introduction/)**. These practices provided me with solutions for simplifying the DOM structure, creating descriptive CSS styles, and self-documenting my code.

Reading up on the Windi documentation also provided me with insight for using BEM styling and improving the DOM's readability... (examples).
