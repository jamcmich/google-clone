### üöß Problem Solving

#### Styling Conventions

This project was my first exposure to using **[WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/guide/)** (an on-demand alternative to **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)**). Although Windi is convenient for styling elements on the fly, it suffers from the same issues as Tailwind: lack of legibility, inability to chain selectors, cluttering the DOM, etc. I realized the need for a consistent naming scheme after styling my first few React components and began researching a flexible solution.

After looking into the issue, I discovered a CSS naming convention created by BEM for writing cleaner and more readable class names. You can read up on the methodology with examples in **[BEM's official guide](http://getbem.com/introduction/)**. These practices provided me with solutions for simplifying the DOM structure, creating descriptive CSS styles, and self-documenting my code.

Reading up on the Windi documentation allowed me to **[incorporate Windi's utility classes in an external stylesheet](#windicss-external-stylesheet)** and preserve my application's class naming schemes. Even though this method would invalidate one of the framework's biggest advantages, I was able to reduce the clutter of my JSX files and create a solution with BEM conventions in mind.

#### Tooltips

Since React is a very flexible library, many developers turn to third-party solutions when it comes to certain features. For example, some components on Google's search page provide users with tooltips on hover and I needed a way to incorporate this functionality into my project.

**[React Tooltip](https://github.com/wwayne/react-tooltip)** is a library with almost 3k stars on GitHub. Many developers rely on external solutions such as this one assuming the library will be well maintained and up-to-date. Unfortunately, myself and many others were running into **[compatibility issues between React Tooltip and React 18](https://github.com/wwayne/react-tooltip/issues/777)**. The repository had been struggling to find a maintainer and likely wouldn't be updated for the new version of React anytime soon.

I decided to create **[a simple, reusable tooltip system](#custom-tooltips)** that complimented my project instead of relying on the inconsistencies of an external library. This solution was lightweight and allowed me to wrap icons within my ``<Tooltip />`` component and create custom tooltip styles.
